# neural-fingerprinting
Neural audio fingerprinting model for Music Informatics course at QMUL. Still work in progress - don't try to use.

I'm trying an audio SimCLR setup, similar to:
```Chang, Sungkyun, et al. "Neural audio fingerprint for high-specific audio retrieval based on contrastive learning." ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2021.```
in PyTorch, using different input representations, encoders, and possibly other stuff.
